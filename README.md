## Game description

The game starts with you (white ball), the white squere (which has to be taken) and the color ball (your enemy).
After you capture the squere, a new ball is created and you score one point. 
There are four types of randomly generated balls: 

>The purple ball bounces off the edge of the board and runs in straight lines. 

>The green ball jumps and moves in arcs.

>The yellow ball protects the squere.

>The blue ball follows the player.
